# flask_ecommerce
E-commerce store built with Flask.

Home page will always show 5 random items in a carousel. User may browse available products by category, but cannot add items to cart unless they are signed in. The cart updates as items are added, and you may delete the entire cart, or update-quantity/delete specific items. The total price takes care of itself. Every product is clickable so you will be taken to a page that will show more info for that specific item.
